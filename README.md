# my-taxi-service
Here is my first project uploaded to GitHub. This is a primitive implementation of the taxi service, in which you can perform the following actions:
1. Create (register) a new driver in our service and get information about all drivers already in the DB
2. Create a car manufacturer and get information about all manufacturers already in the DB
3. Create a new car, specifying the model and name of the manufacturer, as well as get data about all cars registered in DB
4. Assign a specific driver for a specific car, one car can have several drivers

To test the code, you need Tomcat version 9.0.50 and some time:)
